**** This Project is assigned in CS 341 (Foundations of Computer Science II) ****

Project: DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata) that accepts and/or rejects particular strings of Language L where DFA M = (Q, Σ, δ, q1, F).

The purpose of the project written in C++ is to easily understand how Finite Automation works especially in a very practical point of view. 

The states are listed in the 5-Tuple Definition Document while the visual representation is also posted in the repository.

There is also an output text file that shows various amounts of cases that are accepted or rejected.
